## What should I know before getting started?
1. Sanctuary Zero is an open-source project targeting to facilitate messaging in a secure and synchronous manner.
2. The transience of messages and anonymity of the users conveying them are the most important things to consider.
3. In no circumstances can the project replace existing technologies due to its experimental nature of implementation.
4. The project aims to be secure and ways of achieving it but it is yet to be audited on the basis of security.
5. The major dependencies that the project makes use of are `websockets`, `python-prompt-toolkit`, `click` and `cryptography`.
6. The project is purely written in `Python` so an experience in the language and the aforesaid dependencies can be helpful.
